Software setup
==============

Set locales
+++++++++++

Since the config-file contains layouts for multiple languages, assure to have a utf-8 compatible locale::

    echo $LANG

should return something, containing utf-8 at the end.
E.g.::

    en_US.UTF-8

If not, check this website, to adjust it: http://perlgeek.de/en/article/set-up-a-clean-utf8-environment


.. _wordclock_software:

The wordclock software
++++++++++++++++++++++

.. _download_software:

Download software
-----------------

Clone the wordclock software to the directory ~/rpi_wordclock (to run the actual wordclock)::

    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/bk1285/rpi_wordclock.git


.. _3rd_party_deps_packages:

3rd party dependencies (packages)
---------------------------------

To install 3rd party dependencies (packages) enter in a terminal/commandline::

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-scipy scons git swig fonts-freefont-ttf libopenjp2-7

.. _temperature_sensor:

(Optional) dependencies to readout temperature sensor
-----------------------------------------------------

To read out an temperature sensor (AM2302), which can additionally be connected to the raspberry via GPIOs, install the according dependencies:

These dependencies are http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/index.html

and::

    sudo pip install am2302_rpi


.. _3rd_party_deps_python:

3rd party dependencies (python packages)
----------------------------------------

To install 3rd party python dependencies (packages) run::

    cd ~/rpi_wordclock
    sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt


.. _adopt_software:

Adopt software
--------------

To adjust the wordclock to your own settings, create and edit the file ~/rpi_wordclock/wordclock_config/wordclock_config.cfg

To start over, you might just copy the file ~/rpi_wordclock/wordclock_config/wordclock_config.example.cfg and adopt this file.

Note: Each plugin of the wordclock project has its own section in the config-file (create it, if needed, but not existant)

.. note:: If your wordclock has a stencil layout or display resolution, which is not supported yet, you might need to adopt the
  software by providing your own `wiring`-class (to the file wordclock_tools/wiring.py)


.. _run_software:

Run software
------------

To run the wordclock software (with adapted wiring and config-file) do::

    cd ~/rpi_wordclock
    sudo python wordclock.py

In case, the whole thing is not working as expected: Maybe the section :ref:`trouble-shooting` might help...


.. _run_software_on_startup:

Make software run on every startup
----------------------------------

Add the python-script to crontab by calling the command::

    sudo crontab -e

Add here::

    @reboot sudo python /home/pi/rpi_wordclock/wordclock.py

Access the wordclock via webinterface
-------------------------------------

Visit the wordclocks webinterface by entering the wordclocks IP to your browers address bar.
